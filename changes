Made spectrogram much faster and have more distinct colors for the different
levels (may be a little gaudy now). Also has log frequency mode and little
different scale.  Made selection not redraw spectrogram.

Sped up drawing of play cursor

Sped up declick

Sped up save and restore of undo.  Also added progress bar and saved channel_selection_mask

Changed scaling to use *= and /= so scaling woudn't go negative

Changed drawing waveform to look at all samples for pixel to give better
display of amplitudes for your pseudo max.  I might prefer a true max so you
know how close spots are to maximum.

Added automatic song marking and manual song marker editing.  Added simple
CD-TEXT for toc file.  Edit->Mark songs to mark with preference for
expected silence length.  You can move/add/delete them manually and
select around them to easily see/hear them. 

Fixed bug on slider where gwc might read past end of file due to scroll
bar change not limiting end to number of samples

Some changes to menus.  Added marker options, right aligned field labels

Fixed some drawing where you zoomed in and coordinates overflowed short so
things would draw in the wrong location (gint is actuall treated as short)

Changed AtoS to agree with the screen which was drawn with one seperator
down the middle instead of two unused areas at the top.  Also made it so
it clipped to the two drawing areas so top waveform wouldn't leak into bottom.

Some cleanup to status bar progress

Made error if write fails to undo data.  Program exits.  Prevents using bad
undo file and making changes that can't be undone.  Seemed like a lot more
work to do something better.

Also
KNOWN BUGS:
----------- 

>Select a selection, save it, selection is no longer marked,
>        zoom out, selection is now marked 

Think this is fixed along with other problems with highlighting on expose
events

>Spectral view button needs a 'working' dialog.

Added.  Also much faster

>When 'undo'ing' no progress bar
Added (but resampling audio doesn't have one). Saving and restoring undo much
faster also



Things I noticed but didn't fix.

Denoise can overflow so large positive signals become large negative.  No
warning is given either when this happens.

If you denoise with  1 channel selected strange things happen to the other.

---- part 2
Removed F# from menu.

Attached find next marker to n

index_20Hz was calculated before FFT_SIZE was set

removed redraw from zoom since set scrollbar does that (indirectly).  Made
sonogram redraw twice while zooming in.

fixed error in merging log sonogram stuff in

Fixed seg fault in sonogram

Fixed draw_a_line when zooming in so lines don't draw at wrong location

Fixed scroll_bar_changed so it can't set sample past end of file

Made some changes to mark_song to improve performance with my albums

Saved song markers and cdtext info to .gwc file

Added accelerators to menus and removed from keyboard checking case

Changed delete song markers to delete all selected song markers for consistency
---- part 3
Added interface (frontend) to lame/oggenc for MP3 and Ogg encodings of selected waveform portions.

Fixed issue with warnings if closing pop up windows via X in corner.

Fixed issues with performing tasks with no file opened causing segfault.

Fixed issue of trying to play when sonogram is being built.

Fixed issue of trying to display sonogram(or do anything) while file is being played.

Added some fixes to improve speed of display/amplify and some other functions.
