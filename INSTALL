Installation is via the classic `autoreconf -i; ./configure; make; make install`.
Refer to the README for further information.
This file documents specific installation problems which may be encountered.

Problems with linking:

You don't have libsndfile in a standard place, like /usr/lib, but /usr/local/lib
	-- make sure /usr/local/lib is in your /etc/ld.so.conf file, and reload the runtime loader (man ldconf)
	-- you will need to add /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable, like so:

	       export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

---
Problems with autotools versions:

e.g. building on OSX "Snow Leopard" (10.6) I had problems like this:

	configure.in:3: require Automake 1.12, but have 1.10

I was using homebrew, so I had to install newer versions e.g. `brew install automake`, then do this to use these versions rather than the system ones:

	export PATH="/usr/local/opt/automake/bin:/usr/local/opt/autoconf/bin:$PATH"

---
Problems with pkgconfig:

e.g. building on OSX leopard I had problems like this:

	checking for gtk+-2.0... no
	configure: error: Package requirements (gtk+-2.0) were not met:

	Package 'libpng', required by 'cairo', not found

	Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
	installed software in a non-standard prefix.

	Alternatively, you may set the environment variables GTK_CFLAGS
	and GTK_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
	See the pkg-config man page for more details.

To solve it I had to do this:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(find /usr/local/Cellar -name 'pkgconfig' -type d | grep lib/pkgconfig | tr '\n' ':' | sed s/.$//)

I think this is probably fixed, but it was previously reported that `make install` did not work due to datadir not being defined.
This was fixed by configuring with `--datadir=$pkgdir/usr/share`. $pkgdir related to the distribution's packaging system.
