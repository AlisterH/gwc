Issue the command:

"make install"

This installs the gwc binary in /usr/local/bin/gwc

Document files are installed in /usr/share/doc/gwc

Problems with linking:

1) You don't have libsndfile in a standard place, like /usr/lib, but /usr/local/lib
	-- make sure /usr/local/lib is in your /etc/ld.so.conf file, and reload the runtime loader (man ldconf)
	-- you will need to add /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable, like so:

	       export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

Problems with Slackware Gnome libs:
	(Thanks to Kevin Hass, April 24, 2006  for this info)

	Go to www.linuxpackages.net (which focuses on Slackware), and install the
	Freerock-gnome for slackware.  Then also get the libsndfile from there
	(or get it's source, and compile it yourself).  Then GWC builds cleanly.
	[ But the Help menu option does not work, if you don't use GNOME (I use KDE),
	but I can read the help files manually ]
