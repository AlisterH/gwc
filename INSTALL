Issue the command:

"make install"

By default this installs the gwc binary in /usr/local/bin/gwc

Problems with linking:

1) You don't have libsndfile in a standard place, like /usr/lib, but /usr/local/lib
	-- make sure /usr/local/lib is in your /etc/ld.so.conf file, and reload the runtime loader (man ldconf)
	-- you will need to add /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable, like so:

	       export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
