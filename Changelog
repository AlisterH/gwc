BUGFIX: fix various bugs, crashes and failures in gwcbatch, particularly for filenames including spaces, and file extensions other than .wav (which were previously overwritten without creating a backup)
NEW: implement drag-and-drop to open a file
NEW: allow to select audio during playback (this was possible in earlier versions but the ability was lost)
NEW: allow zoom actions to stop playback
CODE: minor ui and code improvements
CODE: fix compile failure with gcc10
DOC: minor doc improvements; implement --help

April 16, 2019
This release is mostly fixes and improvements for osx packaging.
Note that the version number has jumped to -04 because I had several attempts at creating an osx package, using up some numbers, and I don't want to create confusion between them and newer releases.
(I figured it was a good idea to use the same three numbers in CFBundleVersion, but actually it doesn't support 0 as the first number. So in future I should instead append something like "+build1".)

BUGFIX: playback mono files at correct speed with pulseaudio backend.
NEW: warn the user if the current working directory is not writable, as that causes big problems.
CODE: allow building with pulseaudio backend on osx, as the coreaudio backend is broken (playback does not work in the previous OSX packages).
CHANGED BEHAVIOUR: on osx write files to sensible locations.
DOC: document optional dependencies (LAME and vorbis-tools).

Minor build/packaging type fixes.

0.22
July 18, 2017
This release is by Alister Hood.  Jeff Welty has advised via email that he has not used GWC for several years and does not have time currently to look at any issues with it.
This release is a port from the old GNOME libraries to plain GTK2 and does not include major changes in functionality.  There is plenty of bugfixing and cleanup of how things work, but much of it will only be apparent in less typical "corner cases".
A more detailed summary of the changes is below.  For full details refer to the git commit log at https://github.com/AlisterH/gwc
Patches or pull requests are of course encouraged!

BUGFIX: apply Debian patch to prevent crash on x86_64.
BUGFIX: apply Debian patch to build successfully if using clang.
BUGFIX: solve various problems with ogg and mp3 encoding.
BUGFIX: don't freeze when stopping alsa playback (please report if you do still experience and freezes).
NEW: on Mac OSX integrate with the system "application menu", dock and basic keyboard shortcuts.
NEW: support for gtk-can-change-accels = 1 (in ~/.gtkrc-2.0).
CODE: reimplemented the gui to use plain gtk2, removing the dependencies on obsolete Gnome libraries.  This also fixes a number of minor gui bugs and modernises things like file choosers.
CODE: various other gui bugfixes and improvements.
CODE: follow more standards for where we install files.
CODE: various fixes to the build system, including actually installing to --prefix.
CODE: general cleanup including removing duplicated or unnecessary files, fixing typos etc.
DOC: remove the old help manual in favour of the quickstart guide, and show the help without requiring a GNOME environment.
CHANGED CONFIG FILE: the location has changed - typically it was ~/.gnome2/gnome_wave_cleaner and is now ~/.config/gtk-wave-cleaner/gwc.conf
The format has not changed so it is possible for you to move an old file to the new location.
CHANGED BEHAVIOUR: Undo files and clipboard data are now saved in $XDG_CACHE_HOME if possible (rather than the current working directory).  Undo files are saved in unique subdirectories so multiple instances of gwc won't interfere with each other.  The clipboard is shared between all gwc instances unless you override $XDG_CACHE_HOME (or it does not exist).
CHANGED NAME: GWC no longer depends on the deprecated GNOME libs, does not depend on GTK3, and is not very "Gnomish".  Including Gnome in the name is therefore misleading, so the full name has been changed to "Gtk Wave Cleaner".
RENAMED EXECUTABLE: there is at least one other project named gwc, so to avoid packaging clashes the executable is renamed to gtk-wave-cleaner.  Symlink or alias it as gwc if the long name bothers you ;)

Feb 2, 2013
BUGFIX: warning on opening audio device incorrectly displayed pulse audio message when neither alsa or pulse audio was being used
BUGFIX: Encoding to ogg or mp3 has always been broken, can only encode to once during GWC session.  Fixed by using named pipe
NEW: A simple front end for encoding to MP3s.  Only a -V xx encoding option,
but can have default artist and album tags now, and enter trackname when
encoding the selection.  Kind of klunky user interface, but it works.

NEW: Alpha code -- trying to read MP3's and OGG file types.
