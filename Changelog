GWC Changelog
0.21-19
Feb 2,2013
BUGFIX: warning on opening audio device incorrectly displayed pulse audio message when neither alsa or pulse audio was being used
BUGFIX: Encoding to ogg or mp3 has always been broken, can only encode to once during GWC session.  Fixed by using named pipe
NEW: A simple front end for encoding to MP3s.  Only a -V xx encoding option,
but can have default artist and album tags now, and enter trackname when
encoding the selection.  Kind of klunky user interface, but it works.

COPYRIGHT: Some important copyright notices from the cephes library now included in i0.c i1.c and chbevl.c

NEW: Alpha code -- trying to read MP3's and OGG file types.
