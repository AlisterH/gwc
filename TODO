The Gnome Wave Cleaner Project BUG/TODO List (In order of importance)
7/13/2002 - Jeff Welty, Redhawk Technologies

KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

ANNOYANCES:
-----------

Document declick settings. Not clear what effect the settings have. Eg
        Strong Declick sensitivity. What's effect does an increase have?
        What's the upper limit?

Help does not really explain that GWC commits all changes to the original
file instantly, and undo saves the deltas needed to get back, so on
exit all your changes are saved.  (Perhaps all that is really required
is a "Save changes" on exit, and then if the answer is no execute all
the undos).

"Save Selection As" does not save the current view, it requires a selection...

FEATURE SUGGESTIONS (in order of implementation) :
--------------------------------------------------

Method to play from a arbitrary point - i.e. play from current marker

FEATURES THAT WOULD BE HARDER TO IMPLEMENT( but still good ideas :-)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Scroll when selecting

Remember the last 3 files edited, and show them in the file drop-down menu for easier opening

Put de-click iterator on main screen?

LADSPA-ize the filters. (Not possible)

Save as mp3, ogg (run though 'lame'?) (Done)
