GWC 0.22
--------------

This is the README for Gtk Wave Cleaner, a gui application to remove noise (hiss, pops and clicks) from audio files in WAV and similar formats.

Requirements
------------
- a *nix based operating system i.e. linux, bsd, osx etc.  GWC can be run on Windows either in a Linux virtual machine or in "windows subsystem for linux" on 64bit Windows 10 using  pulseaudio and X11 servers for windows.
- gtk2 (www.gtk.org); included in common Linux distributions.
- libsndfile (www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/); there are packages available for common Linux distributions.
- either the OSS, ALSA or Pulse Audio sound drivers, or Mac OSX.
- fftw libs (www.fftw.org); there are packages available for common Linux distributions.

License
------------
The source code and all associated files are freely available under the GNU General Public License (GPL) agreement.

Installation
------------
If you are using a release source tarball, extract it (tar -xvzf <...>).
Enter the directory created.
Run "./configure".
Run "make".
Run "make install".

"gtk-wave-cleaner" is the program file.  All you have to do is run it, or click on the menu entry.

In case you are building the source from git you will first need to run "autoreconf -i"

Additional options
------------------
Run "./configure --help" for additional compile options.
By default the GWC binary is installed /usr/local/bin/ and document files are installed in 
/usr/local/share/doc/gtk-wave-cleaner.  Override this with "./configure --prefix=/usr" or similar.
If you have playback problems try disabling alsa (--disable-alsa) to use oss.  In an alsa environment 
you can use it with aoss if necessary.
Distributions may want to enable pulseaudio (--enable-pa).
Note that mp3 and ogg reading support are currently still broken, so ignore those options.

If you have problems installing check whether they are documented in the INSTALL file.

Instructions for use:
