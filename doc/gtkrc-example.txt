## HOW TO USE ##

## This file is distributed as an example of gtk settings which people might find useful.
## To apply these settings for all programs they should typically be added to ~/.gtkrc-2.0 or ~/.gtkrc-2.0.mine
## Changes will take effect upon restarting the program.
## If a line is prefixed by a # that means it is commented out.

## To use a special gtkrc just for GWC save it along with the config file i.e. as ~/.config/gtk-wave-cleaner/gtkrc
## For reference, if we had not implemented reading this file, you could have still done it by launching GWC like this:
## GTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/doc/gtk-wave-cleaner/gtkrc-example.txt gtk-wave-cleaner



## USEFUL SETTINGS AND EXPLANATION ##

## If you are using a special gtkrc for GWC then you probably want to include your normal gtkrc first, which will bring in your theme, fonts etc.  e.g.:
# include "/home/alister/.gtkrc-2.0"
## It seems you need to specify the actual path of the included file i.e. don't use ~ or $HOME.
## Settings in the special gtkrc must be below the include for them to override anything explicitly set in the included file.

## GWC's toolbar icons are 28x28 and by default gtk scales them down.
## This will instead display the icons at their native size, so they will be bigger and clearer.
## Presumably we don't need all of these for GWC.
gtk-icon-sizes = "panel-menu=28,28:panel=28,28:gtk-menu=28,28:gtk-large-toolbar=28,28:gtk-small-toolbar=28,28:gtk-button=28,28:gtk-dnd=28,28"

## Using this instead would in a default setup increase the icon size slightly but only in the toolbar.
## Combine it with part of the line above to set it to 28 pixels.
# gtk-toolbar-icon-size = large-toolbar

## This is the obvious step to take it further and display them at 200%
## This is useful for high dpi screens like my cellphone, and I guess Apple "retina" displays.
## But how do we make other gui elements like scrollbars bigger too? 
## And do we need to do anything to make text bigger, particularly on OSX or windows?  Perhaps we need a theme designed for hidpi?
# gtk-icon-sizes = "panel-menu=56,56:panel=56,56:gtk-menu=56,56:gtk-large-toolbar=56,56:gtk-small-toolbar=56,56:gtk-button=56,56:gtk-dnd=56,56"

## Allow users to change shortcut keys by hovering the mouse over the respective menu item, and pressing the desired key combination.  
## Sadly this doesn't work in the osx native application menu, which GWC now supports.
## N.B. many other programs probably don't save the changes as this option is not well known.
gtk-can-change-accels=1

## Show icons in the menu.
## Helpful for people to learn which toolbar button is which.  Sadly doesn't work in native osx app menu.
gtk-menu-images=1

## Show icons on buttons e.g. "Save" and "Cancel".
## Not typically used in windows or osx, although MS office is one of many exceptions.
gtk-button-images=1

## use the win32 button ordering instead of the GNOME HIG one.
# gtk-alternative-button-order = 1

## use the win32/osx sort indicators direction.
# gtk-alternative-sort-arrows = 1

## Disable beep on errors (not sure if this affects GWC).
gtk-error-bell = 0
